This Python program demonstrates file handling with error handling.
It:

Asks the user to enter a filename.

Reads the contents of the file.

Converts the text to uppercase.

Writes the modified text into a new file named modified_<filename>.

Handles errors gracefully if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.
